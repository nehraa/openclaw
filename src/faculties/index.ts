/**
 * Faculty system - cognitive architecture subsystems.
 *
 * Faculties are specialized subsystems that provide advanced capabilities:
 * - Self-healing: Automated error fixing
 * - Council: Complex reasoning decomposition
 * - Memory: Deep code indexing and retrieval
 * - Senses: Multimodal input/output
 * - Research: Deep web research
 * - Workflow: Automation creation
 * - Privacy: PII protection
 * - Shepherd: Background code health monitoring
 * - Simulator: Scenario simulation
 * - Autodidact: Capability discovery
